Assignment 5 Write a Bash Script that will run on startup

The Bash script was placed in rc.local to run on startup, it gets the date/time, user name of who is running the script in this case root, and randomly generates cowsay or cowthink using a random animal from the ok cows list, and uses fortune as the message. Then it saves it all to a file for the user to view.
