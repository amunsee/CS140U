Assignment 7: 
Part 1: Create a hello-world Docker clone (image of docker hub under part 1)

Part 2: Create a Dockerfile that uses alpine to run some linux commands - at least cat /etc/os-release and capture ouptut to a file, and make the file available to host machine.

Part 2 ran into some issues with docker, will attempt to fix and get file working, Dockerfile was working and succesfully making a docker image until I attempted to cat the os info to a file at which point it stopped working and kept giving me errors about not being able to access the path. Non working code Dockerfile under part 2, and bash script I attempted to run from Dockerfile under part 2 bash.
